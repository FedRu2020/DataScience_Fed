# DataScience_Fed repository

This is my petprojects respository where I put projects I did during my Data Science study

The repository consists of the following projects:

1. ['Deploy Cancer prediction']()
- Deploy of model for cancer prediction using simple flask server

2. ['module_0']()
- Game to get guess, predict numbers and returns amount of attempts using bnary search

3. ['module_1']()
- Using Pandas and numpy in data analysis of IMDB dataset

4. ['module_2']()
- EDA with preparation of dataset for the model for prediction of results on math exam of students

5. ['module_3']()
- Prediction of restaurant rating (Kaggle competition) using RandomForestRegressor

6. ['module_4']()
- Working with mySQL as a data analytic at airflight company.
- Analysis of data from flights DB and preparation of dataset with flights which need to be excluded from the schedule.

7. ['module_5']()
- Bank Scoring classification in Kaggle competition. 

8. ['module_6']()
